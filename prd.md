# PRD: Flutter Riverpod Clean Architecture Documentation

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: Flutter Riverpod Clean Architecture Documentation
- Version: 1.0.0

### 1.2 Product summary

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the Flutter application architecture implemented in this project. The architecture follows clean architecture principles with Riverpod for state management.

The project uses a feature-first organization with each feature implementing the three layers of clean architecture: data, domain, and presentation. This approach enhances maintainability, testability, and scalability by providing clear separation of concerns and dependencies that flow inward.
